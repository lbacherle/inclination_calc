    inclination_calc.jl

Simple Julia program to calculate launchsite parameters.

Modes:
    1) Calculate inertial Azimuth (disregarding Earths rotation) for a launchsite or latitude and a desired inclination
    2) Calculate rotational Azimuth (taking into account Earth rotation) for a launchsite or latitude and a desired inclination
    3) Calculate resulting Inclination for a launchsite or latitude and an Azimuth angle

Conventions:
\t1) All angles must be given in degrees
    2) Inclination and Latitude are defined from -90째 to +90째, Azimuth from 0째 to 360째
