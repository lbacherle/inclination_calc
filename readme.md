&emsp;inclination_calc.jl

Simple Julia program to calculate launchsite parameters.

Modes:\
&emsp;1) Calculate inertial Azimuth (disregarding Earths rotation) for a launchsite or latitude and a desired inclination\
&emsp;2) Calculate rotational Azimuth (taking into account Earth rotation) for a launchsite or latitude and a desired inclination\
&emsp;3) Calculate resulting Inclination for a launchsite or latitude and an Azimuth angle\
&emsp;4) Compare propellant mass needed for different latitudes (assuming an eastwards launch)

Conventions:\
&emsp;1) All angles must be given in degrees\
&emsp;2) Inclination and Latitude are defined from -90째 to +90째, Azimuth from 0째 to 360째

Input:\
&emsp;-If file called 'values.csv' in the correct format (see example values.csv) exists, reads the values from this csv and prints all output to files\
&emsp;-If this file does not exist, starts an interactive mode and allows user to freely input variables

Input File:\
&emsp;-Each row corresponds to one of the 4 modes
&emsp;-Input parameters that are not needed for that specific mode should be set to 0.0
&emsp;-File needs to be called values.csv and should be located in the same folder as the script

Dependencies:\
&emsp;1) The Plots and the CSV packages are needed to show the resulting plots. Installation can be done by typing julia into the command line to start the REPL, then typing the following:\
&emsp;&emsp;julia> using package\
&emsp;&emsp;julia> Pkg.add("Plots")\
&emsp;&emsp;julia> Pkg.add("CSV")
